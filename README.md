_You Need A Better Budgettting Applicaiton_

-------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to YNABBA. We're not currently accepting contributions, as we're still laying down the framework. However if you're curious about what this is, let me explain it. We're going to use node.js to create a budgetting service. We'll be using MySQL for our database, and Angular for our front end. Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/YUKV/YNABBA/wiki) for our design docs.
